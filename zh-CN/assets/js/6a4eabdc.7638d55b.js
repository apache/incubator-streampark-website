When other contributors or learners are viewing the code, it can\u2019t be intuitively understood through commit log.\nThe purpose of the changes before and after the submission, as Peter Hutterer said\uff1aRe-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can\u2019t avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it as much as possible.
