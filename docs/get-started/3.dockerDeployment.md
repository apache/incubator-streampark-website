This tutorial for docker deploy StreamPark

## Prepare
    Docker 1.13.1+
    Docker Compose 1.28.0+

### 1. Install docker

To start the service with docker, you need to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) first

### 2. Install docker-compose

To start the service with docker-compose, you need to install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) first

## Apache StreamPark™ Deployment

### 1. Apache StreamPark™ deployment based on h2 and docker-compose

This method is suitable for beginners to learn, become familiar with the features, and use on a lightweight scale.

H2 is a lightweight, high-performance embedded relational database that is easy to integrate into Java applications. It has a syntax similar to MySQL and supports data persistence. StreamPark defaults to using the H2 database, allowing developers to quickly start projects

To achieve data persistence, you can configure the datasource.h2-data-dir parameter to specify the storage path for the data files. This ensures that data will not be lost even if the service is restarted

datasource.h2-data-dir: Used to specify the storage path of the H2 database files, by default located in the ~/streampark/h2-data/ directory in the user's home directory

Regarding the H2 console, according to the configuration code, the access path /h2-console has been set to be enabled by default and allows access from other computers. The console can be used to execute SQL queries, manage databases, etc

After opening /h2-console, fill in JDBC_URL as the H2 database file directory + /metadata, for example, if the default configuration has not been modified, fill in as jdbc:h2:~/streampark/h2-data/metadata

Username and password: The default username is admin, the password is streampark

### 2. Deployment

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-streampark/dev/docker/docker-compose.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-streampark/dev/docker/.env
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the service is started, StreamPark can be accessed through http://localhost:10000 and also through http://localhost:8081 to access Flink. Accessing the StreamPark link will redirect you to the login page, where the default user and password for StreamPark are admin and streampark respectively. To learn more about the operation, please refer to the user manual for a quick start.

### 3. Configure flink home

### 4. Configure flink-session cluster

Note:When configuring the flink-sessin cluster address, the ip address is not localhost, but the host network ip, which can be obtained through ifconfig

### 5. Submit flink job

#### Use existing Mysql services
This approach is suitable for enterprise production, where you can quickly deploy StreamPark based on docker and associate it with an online database
Note: The diversity of deployment support is maintained through the .env configuration file, make sure there is one and only one .env file in the directory

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-streampark/dev/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-streampark/dev/deploy/docker/mysql/.env
vim .env
```

First, you need to create the "streampark" database in MySQL, and then manually execute the corresponding SQL found in the schema and data for the relevant data source.

After that, modify the corresponding connection information.

```shell
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=mysql
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/streampark?useSSL=false&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=false&useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift=true&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=GMT%2B8
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=streampark
```

```
docker-compose up -d
```
#### Use existing Pgsql services

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-streampark/dev/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-streampark/dev/deploy/docker/pgsql/.env
vim .env
```
Modify the corresponding connection information

```shell
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=pgsql
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/streampark?stringtype=unspecified
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=postgres
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=streampark
```

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

## Build images based on source code for Apache StreamPark™ deployment
```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampark.git
cd incubator-streampark/deploy/docker
vim docker-compose
```

```shell
    build:
      context: ../..
      dockerfile: deploy/docker/console/Dockerfile
#    image: ${HUB}:${TAG}
```
![](/doc/image/streampark_source_generation_image.png)

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

## Docker-Compse Configuration

The docker-compose.yaml file will reference the configuration from the env file, and the modified configuration is as follows:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  ## streampark-console container
  streampark-console:
    ## streampark image
    image: apache/streampark:latest
    ## streampark image startup command
    command: ${
   RUN_COMMAND}
    ports:
      - 10000:10000
    ## Environment configuration file
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      ## Declare environment variable
      HADOOP_HOME: ${
   HADOOP_HOME}
    volumes:
      - flink:/streampark/flink/${
   FLINK}
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro
      - ~/.kube:/root/.kube:ro
    privileged: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - streampark

  ## flink-jobmanager container
  flink-jobmanager:
    image: ${
   FLINK_IMAGE}
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    command: jobmanager
    volumes:
      - flink:/opt/flink
    env_file: .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    networks:
      - streampark

  ## streampark-taskmanager container
  flink-taskmanager:
    image: ${
   FLINK_IMAGE}
    depends_on:
      - flink-jobmanager
    command: taskmanager
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
    env_file: .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    networks:
      - streampark

networks:
  streampark:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  flink:
```

Finally, execute the start command:

```shell
cd deploy/docker
docker-compose up -d
```

You can use `docker ps` to check if the installation was successful. If the following information is displayed, it indicates a successful installation:

## Uploading Configuration to the Container

In the previous `env` file, `HADOOP_HOME` was declared, with the corresponding directory being "/streampark/hadoop". Therefore, you need to upload the `/etc/hadoop` from the Hadoop installation package to the `/streampark/hadoop` directory. The commands are as follows:

```shell
## Upload Hadoop resources
docker cp entire etc directory streampark-docker_streampark-console_1:/streampark/hadoop
## Enter the container
docker exec -it streampark-docker_streampark-console_1 bash
## Check
ls
```

In addition, other configuration files, such as Maven's `settings.xml` file, are uploaded in the same manner.
