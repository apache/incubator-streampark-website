## Project Management

Apache Flink and Apache Spark offer programming models based on Java code for job development. For these types of jobs, users are required to write the program, build and package it to produce the target Jar, and then execute a command line (flink run or spark-submit) to submit the job. StreamPark offers project management capabilities, allowing users to easily add Apache Flink/Spark projects built using Java Maven into StreamPark for management. With StreamPark, the packaging and building of the project are taken care of, This dramatically simplifies user usage.

## How to use

Click "Project Management" and add a new project. You will be taken to the project add page. The operation is as follows:

![Hot to use](/doc/image/project/project.gif)

## Parameter Description:

- Project Name: (Required) Project name, cannot be repeated
- Project Type: (Required) Project type, currently only supports Apache Flink
- Repository URLï¼š(Required) URL of the project repository, e.g: project's GitHub address or GitLab address
- Password: (Optional) If the project requires a password to access
- Branches: (Required) The project branch: Will be automatically loaded based on the Repository URL to select the optional branch.
- Build Argument: (Optional) Project build parameters
  The build parameters here are the standard parameters of Maven. For example, if you want to specify the profile as dev, then here is -Pdev, and other parameters are inferred from this.

- POM: (Optional) The location of the pom.xml file of the target module to be built. For example, if the [StreamPark Quickstart](https://github.com/apache/incubator-streampark-quickstart) project directory structure is as follows:

  ![Pom](/doc/image/project/pom-position.png)

  Now, if you only need to build the `apacheflinksql_demo` module, and you don't need to build any other modules. Then, you need to specify the relative path of the pom.xml file of the `apacheflinksql_demo` module, which is: `quickstart-flink/quickstart-apacheflink/apacheflinksql_demo/pom.xml`


:::tip Remind
In StreamPark, the project management system has a built-in Maven build capability, similar to Jenkins, but only supports projects built using Maven. It has performed security verification and interception of dangerous parameters on parameter input (Build Argument). If the user's project itself has some risks or vulnerabilities, the user needs to handle them by himself. Some risky operations, such as using the exec-maven-plugin plug-in in the user's project, whether these plug-ins will be executed, and what risks will be brought, depending on the user's project itself.
