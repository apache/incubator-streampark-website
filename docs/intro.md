# StreamPark
make stream processing easier!!!

> An amazing framework makes stream processing easier.

## üöÄ What is StreamPark

`StreamPark` is an easy-to-use stream processing application development framework and one-stop stream processing operation platform, Aimed at ease building and managing streaming applications, StreamPark provides scaffolding for writing streaming process logics with Apache Flink and Apache Spark.
StreamPark also provides a professional task management including task development, scheduling, interactive query, deployment, operation, maintenance, etc.

## Why StreamPark

Apache Flink and Apache Spark are widely used as the next generation of big data streaming computing engines.  Based on a bench of excellent experiences combined with best practices, we extracted the task deployment and runtime parameters into the configuration files. In this way,  an easy-to-use RuntimeContext with out-of-the-box connectors would bring easier and more efficient task development experience. It reduces the learning cost and development barriers, hence developers can focus on the business logic.
On the other hand, It can be challenge for enterprises to use Flink & Spark if there is no professional management platform for Flink & Spark tasks during the deployment phase. StreamPark provides such a professional task management platform, including task development, scheduling, interactive query, deployment, operation, maintenance, etc.

## üéâ Features
* Apache Flink & Spark application development scaffolding
* Supports multiple versions of Flink & Spark
* A range of out-of-the-box connectors
* one-stop stream processing operation platform
* Support catalog„ÄÅolap„ÄÅstreaming-warehouse etc.

## üè≥‚Äçüåà Architecture of StreamPark

The overall architecture of StreamPark is shown in the following figure. StreamPark consists of three parts, they are StreamPark-core, StreamPark-pump, and StreamPark-console.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ StreamPark-core

The positioning of `StreamPark-core` is a framework uesd while developing, it focuses on coding development, regulates configuration files, and develops in the convention over configuration guide.
StreamPark-core provides a development-time RunTime Content and a series of out-of-the-box Connectors. Cumbersome operations are simplified by extending `DataStream-related` methods and integrating DataStream and `Flink sql` api .
development efficiency and development experience will be highly improved because users can focus on the business.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ StreamPark-pump

`StreamPark-pump` is a component similar to `flinkx` which is used for data extraction. It is developed based on various connectors provided in `StreamPark-core` and will be integrated into `StreamPark-console`.
The purpose of developing StreamPark-pump is to create a convenient, fast, out-of-the-box extraction and migration component for real-time big data. We expect it could solve the real-time data source fetching problem.
`StreamPark-pump` is still in planning.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ StreamPark-console

`StreamPark-console` is a comprehensive real-time `low code` data platform that can manage `Flink` tasks more convenient.
It integrates the experience of many best practices and integrates many functions such as project compilation, release,
parameter configuration, startup, `savepoint`, `flame graph`, `Flink SQL`, monitoring, etc.,
which greatly simplifies the daily operation of Flink tasks and maintenance. The ultimate goal is to create a one-stop big data platform,
which can provide a solution that integrates flow and batch, and integrates lake and warehouse.
This platform uses technologies including but not limited to:

* [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org)
* [Apache YARN](http://hadoop.apache.org)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/)
* [Mybatis](http://www.mybatis.org)
* [Mybatis-Plus](http://mp.baomidou.com)
* [Flame Graph](http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs)
* [JVM-Profiler](https://github.com/uber-common/jvm-profiler)
* [Vue](https://cn.vuejs.org/)
* [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
* [Ant Design of Vue](https://antdv.com/)
* [ANTD PRO VUE](https://pro.antdv)
* [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/)
* [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
* ...
